# Assignment 10 – Creational Design Patterns in Library System

## 💻 Language: Python
I chose Python for its simplicity, readability, and support for rapid prototyping of design patterns.

## 🧠 Patterns Used

| Simple Factory | Centralized item creation | `simple_factory.py` |
| Factory Method | Interface + subclasses for Payment | `factory_method.py` |
| Abstract Factory | Multiple UI components (buttons) | `abstract_factory.py` |
| Builder | Step-by-step pizza creation | `builder.py` |
| Prototype | Clone book objects | `prototype.py` |
