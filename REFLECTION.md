# Reflection on Open-Source Collaboration

This assignment taught me the importance of preparing a project for external contributors.

## ðŸš€ Improvements Based on Feedback

Peers mentioned that having test instructions in the README helped them onboard quickly. I also improved naming conventions in routes and models for clarity.

## ðŸ§  Challenges in Onboarding

- Some classmates struggled with environment setup.
- GitHub permissions were initially confusing for new contributors.
- Reviewing PRs manually was time-consuming.

## ðŸŽ¯ Lessons Learned

- Good documentation is essential for a collaborative project.
- Setting up labels and guidelines makes it easier for newcomers to contribute.
- GitHub's branching and PR workflow mirrors real-world team collaboration.

Open-source is more than just code â€” it's about clarity, collaboration, and community.
